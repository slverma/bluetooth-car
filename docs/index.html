    <h1>Privacy Policy for BluetoothCar</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 01 January 2026</p>

    <p>
      BluetoothCar ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy. This Privacy
      Policy explains how our mobile application BluetoothCar handles user
      information.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Collection</h2>
    <p>
      BluetoothCar does <strong>not collect, store, or share</strong> any
      personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>Bluetooth Permission</h2>
    <p>
      The app uses Bluetooth permission solely to discover, connect, and
      communicate with nearby Bluetooth-enabled devices (such as a
      Bluetooth-controlled car).
    </p>

    <h2>Location Permission</h2>
    <p>
      Location permission may be requested because Android requires it to scan
      nearby Bluetooth devices. BluetoothCar does
      <strong>not access, collect, track, or store</strong> your location data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>BluetoothCar does not share any data with third parties.</p>

    <h2>Internet Usage</h2>
    <p>
      BluetoothCar does not require an internet connection and does not transmit
      any data to external servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      BluetoothCar is not designed to collect personal information from children
      under the age of 13.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      Since no personal data is collected or stored, there is no risk of data
      exposure from BluetoothCar.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
      reflected on this page.
    </p>
